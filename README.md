# Better-Allies-through-Teams

Sometimes we slip and use non-inclusive words in our day-to-day conversations. We are implementing a teams bot app which will be a learning mechanism to remind everyone to only inclusive words in their sentences.

Implement a teams bot that'll suggest alternative words to make sure you use inclusive language in your team. For example - if you type "hey guys", it will provide a auto-reply (only visible to you) like "Instead of *guys*, perhaps you mean *folks*?... *[Please consider editing your message so it's more inclusive]*

Other alternative suggestions could be to use "replica or follower" instead of slave and "allowlist" instead of "whitelist".
